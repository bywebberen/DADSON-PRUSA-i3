Version 2.0.7.1

This build of marlin is for 220x280mm buildplates( changed in conf.h file) with TMC2208_STANDALONE stepperdrivers
Change to your likings

The Z probe pin is P2.00 and therefor it is the signalpin on the "servo" connection on the SKR v1.3
And you can connect the E0 heaterFan to the E1 output, Pin 2.04 (it will turn on after 50 degrees Celcius)
