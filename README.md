Update 22.11.2023 - Added in an extruder assembly for the X1C bambulab hotend clone or real (remember this heater is running 24 volt)

Update 10.09.2020 — The Clip-on piece was actually uploaded...! Find it in X-axis folder named: "Homing_Block_sensorless homing.stl"

Update 29.08.2020 — There is a new motor piece for the X-axis part, if you haven't already printed it?
I will make a clipon piece today, which will  work the same. It is for when homing, if you are above the stability piece on the Z-axis, you will get 2 different homes for x-axis - this is of course only when using the sensorless homing version.
